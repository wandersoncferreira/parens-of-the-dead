make this available. Great series.

To start the backend from command line

#+begin_src shell
  clojure -M -m undead.system
#+end_src


To start the frontend from command line (development mode)

#+begin_src shell
  npx shadow-cljs watch undead
#+end_src

The game should be visible at =http://localhost:9009/index.html=

** Emacs users

   There is a =.dir-locals.el= file to setup the project
   correctly. Some useful notes:

   1. Use =C-c p P= to run =projectile-test-project=
   2. =cider-jack-in-clj= in clojure files works as expected
   3. =cider-connect-cljs= after starting the Shadow-Cljs REPL on port 8777.
